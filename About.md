# Rules of the Game Jam:

1. Prior to the start date of the game creation I was not allowed to open Unity or C# to begin any development
2. I was allowed to design and prep any other documentation, look up tutorials, other sources, etc.
3. Once "Day 0" began, I was free to work on the project for 8 days.

# Afterword

  In total the game took about 7 days with an average of 4 hours of dedicated work per day.  One day was a 7 hour day and I took one day off from the total 8 day cycle.  Overall I completed everything I wanted to except the end game screen (game over - win - lose).  This was my first project ever in Unity and using C#.
